Analyzing Engineering Graduates' Outcomes through Cognitive, Technical, and Personality Skills

# About Dataset
The dataset was released by Aspiring Minds from the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO). The study is primarily limited only to students with engineering disciplines. The dataset contains the employment outcomes of engineering graduates as dependent variables (Salary, Job Titles, and Job Locations) along with the standardized scores from three different areas – cognitive skills, technical skills and personality skills. The dataset also contains demographic features. The dataset contains around 40 independent variables and 4000 data points. The independent variables are both continuous and categorical in nature. The dataset contains a unique identifier for each candidate. Below mentioned table contains the details for the original dataset.

# Objective
To conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis of the employment outcomes for engineering graduates, focusing on key factors like salary, specialization, and gender, and to address specific research questions related to these factors.

# Conclusion 
`Key Insights`:The EDA revealed important trends in the employment outcomes of engineering graduates. Specialization, gender, and geographic location significantly impact starting salaries, though academic performance has a less pronounced effect. The analysis also highlighted gender disparities in certain fields, both in terms of representation and salary.
`Implications`:These findings are valuable for educational institutions seeking to improve graduate employability, for employers aiming to address gender disparities, and for policymakers working to ensure equitable job opportunities.

# Learning Outcomes
Here’s a summary of all the learning outcomes through this project : 
`Systematic Data Understanding`: Learned to approach large datasets methodically, focusing on understanding data types and patterns.
`Data Cleaning & Manipulation`: Gained experience in handling missing data, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming variables, creating derived variables and grouping data to prepare it for effective analysis
`Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`: Used visualizations and statistical summaries to uncover patterns and trends across multiple factors.
`Statistical Analysis`: Applied hypothesis testing, interpreting p-values, and selecting appropriate statistical tests.
`Interdisciplinary Insights`: Integrated data from different domains to understand how various factors influence employment outcomes.
`Critical Thinking`: Enhanced problem-solving skills by systematically addressing challenges like missing data and outliers.
`Communication`: Improved ability to translate complex data findings into clear, actionable insights for a non-technical audience.
